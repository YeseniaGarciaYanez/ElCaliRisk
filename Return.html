    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The maximum time to receive your "Return Request for Damage" is 7 days from the date of receipt. Shipping costs are non-refundable. Requests submitted after 7 days from receipt are not eligible for returns.</p>

You must ship the product properly packed and with paid postage. The customer is responsible for insurance, taxes, and any other legal or logistical concerns during the return process.</p>

<h4>When the Product Received is Incorrect:</h4>
