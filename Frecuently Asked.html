      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Calibration</h3>

<h4>What is CALIRISK's Accreditation?</h4>
<p>Our accreditation meets the standards for Calibration Laboratories under ISO/IEC 17025. We are accredited by the ANSI National Accreditation Board (ANAB).</p>

<h4>What is ANAB Accreditation?</h4>
<p>ANSI National Accreditation Board is a non-governmental organization that accredits both public and private sector organizations. It recognizes the capabilities of an organization to perform specific activities, in this case, testing and calibration laboratories under ISO/IEC 17025. ANAB accredits over 2,500 organizations in approximately 80 countries.</p>

<h4>Is ANAB recognized nationally?</h4>
<p>Yes, ANAB operates similarly to EMA, with reliable accreditation processes of equal value globally. You can trust that it is a high-quality, competent, and professional accreditation for all clients and end-users, applying both national and international standards with integrity and timeliness.</p>

<p>All accreditation bodies worldwide generally seek recognition from IAF and ILAC through regional cooperation. ANAB is a signatory of the Multilateral Recognition Agreements (MRAs) of the Inter-American Accreditation Cooperation (IAAC) and the Asia-Pacific Accreditation Cooperation (APAC).</p>

<h4>Is ANAB Accreditation equivalent to EMA?</h4>
<p>Accreditation bodies follow standards from the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC), adhering to international norms.</p>

<p>Yes, thanks to the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA), CALIRISK’s quality management system and reports are equivalent to those of the Mexican Accreditation Entity and any other institution or organization within the ILAC network.</p>

<h4>Are calibrations traceable to other international entities?</h4>
<p>Yes, our calibrations adhere to quality management standards, ensuring traceability from the instrument under test to a national standard.</p>

<p>Traceability is established to the SI (International System of Units) through National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) such as NIST and CENAM. These institutes establish national standards, forming the reference point for the calibration chain followed by each calibration laboratory.</p>

<p>In the calibration process, measurements of the instrument under test are compared to the laboratory standard, linked to the national reference (NMI), and further traced back to the SI (International).</p>

<p>In conclusion, metrological traceability achieved by an accredited laboratory links not only to national but also international standards within the SI.</p>

<h4>How is CALIRISK’s calibration service?</h4>
<p>Our calibration service is characterized by a turnaround time of no more than 5 days. We perform calibration based on your needs, whether you require calibration at your site to minimize production disruption or prefer us to collect and calibrate your equipment in our laboratories.</p>

<p>When you calibrate with us, you will have access to the CALIRISK Portal, allowing you to view and download calibration certificates as needed. The Portal also allows you to track calibration history, manage future calibrations, request collections, and request corrections to your Calibration Certificate.</p>

<p>Our calibration service emphasizes three aspects: Quality, Transparency, and Verifiability.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Every calibration process, including customer service, is executed efficiently and promptly.</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> You can access our service transparently through our sales, support, and technical teams. You will receive quotations, emails, and can visit our website to review our Scope and clarify any questions.</li>
  <li><strong>Verifiability:</strong> You will receive a Calibration Certificate as proof of our capability and adherence to calibration standards. This certificate assists in any audit your company may undergo.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Where are your laboratories located?</h4>
<p>We provide calibration services throughout Mexico, with five strategically located laboratories to cover nearby zones and cities. Our main laboratory is in Tijuana, Baja California, and additional labs are in Mexicali, Baja California; Juarez, Chihuahua; Monterrey, Nuevo Leon; and El Marques, Queretaro.</p>

<h4>What is the calibration service turnaround time?</h4>
<p>Our goal is to complete calibrations in our laboratory within a maximum of 5 days, including pickup and delivery of your instruments to your facility.</p>

<h4>What does your calibration certificate include?</h4>
<p>The Calibration Certificate is the final stage of the calibration process, providing proof that your instrument has undergone calibration. This report shows your instrument's calibration results, meeting ISO/IEC 17025 standards with accuracy, clarity, and objectivity.</p>

<p>Upon completing the calibration, our technical team synchronizes results through our documentation software, generating the Calibration Certificate automatically.</p>
