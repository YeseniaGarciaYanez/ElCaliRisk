        <h2>Shipping and Warranty Policies for CALIRISK'S</h2>
        <p>CALIRISK de México, S.A. de C.V. has a shipping and warranty policy for products purchased on the official CALIRISK Online Store at <a href="https://caliriskdemexico.com/store">https://calirisk</a></p>
        
        <h3>Shipping</h3>
        <h4>Order Management</h4>
        <p>Once payment is confirmed and product availability is verified, and you receive confirmation from our customer service, your package will be shipped to the specified address. This process may take up to 48 hours. Products will not be shipped without receiving payment in our accounts. Please note that we do not process or prepare shipments on holidays or weekends.</p>
        
        <h4>Shipping Cost</h4>
        <p>The shipping cost is chosen by the customer during the purchase process. Our system allows you to select the shipping cost, carrier, and delivery time for your product. Packaging, handling, and packing fees are covered by CALIRISK.</p>
        <p>The shipping cost chosen by the customer will depend on the total weight, volume, destination, and selected carrier. All processes at CALIRISK de México, S.A. de C.V. follow quality assurance policies.</p>
        
        <h4>Package Delivery</h4>
        <p>The carrier should deliver a sealed package/box with the CALIRISK label and/or adhesive tape. Our customer service team will send a copy of the invoice via email if it has already been processed (see the Invoice Management section). The carrier may or may not request a signature upon receipt. We are not responsible for any damage that may occur to your package after delivery; however, we make every effort to protect all products.</p>
        
        <h4>Order Management Intervention</h4>
        <p>If a product shortage occurs after placing your order and making payment, you will be notified by phone and email, with an estimated delivery date. If you choose to receive the available products, they will be shipped normally, and the out-of-stock product will be sent once it is back in stock. If the shipment falls below 400.00 MXN, CALIRISK may send the missing product at no cost to you.</p>
        <p>If you decide you no longer want the out-of-stock product, we can issue a refund for the price of the product. The refund will appear within seven days in the account used for payment. If necessary, we will verify your card number or bank details. To receive the refund, please respond to the out-of-stock notification email indicating your decision. You will receive a confirmation email when the refund is processed.</p>
        
        <h3>Warranty Application</h3>
        <h4>Manufacturer Defect Warranty</h4>
        <p>CALIRISK de México, S.A. de C.V. does not legally represent any of the brands it sells and acts solely as a distributor of the brands displayed and sold through <a href="https://caliriskdemexico.com/store">https://calirisk.com</a>.</p>
        
        <h4>Warranty Process</h4>
        <p>This applies to products purchased from CALIRISK’s online store that have a malfunction. To request a warranty, please provide the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Order number</li>
            <li>Product model</li>
            <li>Serial number</li>
            <li>Detailed description of the issue</li>
            <li>Legible copy of the invoice</li>

        <p>Email this information to <a href="mailto:info@calirisk.com">info@calirisk.com</a> with the subject line "Warranty Application and Order #".</p>
        <p>The customer can claim a manufacturer warranty if there is a manufacturing or assembly defect. CALIRISK will support submitting the request to the manufacturer and reporting the issue. Each product’s warranty varies according to the manufacturer’s terms. The warranty application process follows the manufacturer’s standards and conditions.</p>
        <p>We recommend keeping the product complete and in its original packaging. Packaging/boxes should not be damaged, incomplete, in non-original boxes, or missing documentation such as technical sheets, specifications, instructions, or accessories.</p>
        
        <h4>Notification of Damaged Package by Carrier</h4>
        <p>If a package is delivered in damaged condition, you may choose not to accept the package and take photos as proof of the box and labels. Please email <a href="mailto:store@caliriskdemexico.com">store@calirisk.com</a> with the subject line: "Damaged Package by Carrier" followed by your order number, including photos of the damaged package with visible labels.</p>
        <p>The carrier will notify us that the delivery was not accepted and return the package. Within 24 hours, the shipping partner will notify PKT 1, which will inform us.</p>
        <p>You may also call our customer service number (664)387-5607 to explain your case, then proceed with the above-mentioned email.</p>
        <p>Once CALIRISK reviews the photo evidence and files a complaint with the carrier, we may reschedule your package’s delivery. You will be notified of the new delivery date by phone and email. CALIRISK will not be responsible for any additional fees if the package is returned. The cost of a second shipment will be the customer’s responsibility.</p>
        <p>You also have the option to check the package damage with our shipping provider, PKT1, who handles claims at 800-xxx-xxxx or through a chat on their website at <a href="https://enviospkt1.com">https://enviospkt1.com</a>, where a PKT1 advisor will assist you with the report.</p>
